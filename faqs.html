                  <p>ADUs can be a great way to bring in cash flow in the short term and
                    increase the property value in the long run. The owner not only can
                    rent out an ADU as an apartment but as an office or a studio. ADUs are
                    also perfect for aging parents and grandparents, and your family for sure
                    is something worth your investment. For more detailed number break-down

            <h5>How will ADUs affect my community?</h5>
              <p>While it is true that ADUs may lead to an increase in population density,
                as each ADU can take years to build, communities will not see an impact
                immediately. Nevertheless, many cities have room to accomodate more residents
                without decreasing the quality of life, as proven by Vancouver,
                whose ADU market has boomed since its legalization in 2009.</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h5>How big can an ADU be?</h5>
              <p>For lots between 5,000 and 7,500, ADUs can be up to 500 square feet.
                For lots between 7,500 and 10,000 square feet, ADUs can be up to 640 square feet.
                For lots greater than 10,000 square feet, ADUs can be up to 800 square feet.</p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h5>Why invest in ADUs?</h5>
            <p>ADUs can be a great way to bring in cash flow in the short term and
              increase the property value in the long run. The owner not only can
              rent out an ADU as an apartment but as an office or a studio. ADUs are
              also perfect for aging parents and grandparents, and your family for sure
              is something worth your investment. For more detailed number break-down

          <div>
            <h5>Why have I never heard of ADU’s?</h5>
              <p>Accessory Dwelling Units (ADUs) are also known by many other colloquial
                names such as carriage houses, granny flats, in-law units, or secondary
                suites, to name a few. The legalization of ADUs in America has only begun
                gaining traction within the past decade, Oregon and California as the
                trailblazers of the movement. While laws need time to be put into action,
                it shouldn’t come as a surprise if talk about ADUs becomes relevant
                in your municipality.</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h5>What’s the difference between an ADU and a guest house?</h5>
              <p>Generally, the main differences between a guest house and an ADU
              are that an ADU has a kitchen, while a guest house does not and
              that guest houses are typically smaller than ADUs. These definitions
              can vary by location though, so it is best to consult your local
              housing code for the best information.</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h5>Who lives in ADU’s?</h5>
              <p>In terms of household size, 57% of ADU resident households consist
               of one person and 23% consist of two people.  Age wise, 22% of
               ADU residents in Portland, Oregon (a city with a significant
               sample size of ADU dwellers) are 55+ years old, while the
               median age of residents is 36.46% of those living in ADU’s are
               in an arms’-length relationship to the homeowner.</p>
          </div>
          <div>
          <h5>What is the Chicagoland housing crisis?</h5>
            <p>There are two extremes to the Chicagoland housing crisis. On one
              hand, there are areas that are lacking investment with decaying
              buildings, but on the other, there are areas that suffer from too
              much investment. Landlords are renovating the buildings, jacking up
              rents, and forcing tenants out of them. This increases the affordable
              housing gap and leaves many working-class tenants struggling despite
              the developments in the economy. </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h5>How will ADU’s help with the housing crisis?</h5>
              <p>ADUs increase housing affordability as not only do they increase
                the supply of housing units in general, but the rent for ADUs are
                also usually the third of the rates of other new housing units.
                We don’t have a lot of space to build new buildings, so the ADUs
                allow for the smaller unused areas to be utilized.</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h5>Will ADUs in my community affect parking?</h5>
            <p>While ADUs can mean a slightly increase in the number of cars in your neighborhood, the concerns around parking,
              traffic, and congestion are generally thought to be bigger issues than they are in reality. ADU dwellers own less than
              one car per household (while the average American household has around 2), and cars belonging to ADU households make up
              a small sliver of the total cars in a town or city. If you are still interested in more information on parking
              statistics in ADU-friendly communities, click<a href="https://accessorydwellings.org/2014/07/16/do-adus-cause-neighborhood-parking-problems/" target="_blank"> here</a>.</p>

              <h5>How can I get involved?</h5>
              <p>The best way to get involved is to learn as much as possible
                about ADUs through the information provided on our website and
                others similar, such as …  Contacting your local lawmakers
                about increasing legislation in favor of ADUs is another effective
                option, and we have provided a Lawmaker Contact Email Outline linked
                here to make this as simple as possible.  If you are interested in
                constructing an ADU yourself, use our ADU Contractor Locator tool to
                find builders available in your area.</p>
